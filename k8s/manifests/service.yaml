# The service.yaml file defines a Service object that exposes the go-web-app Deployment to the internet. The Service object listens on port 80 and forwards traffic to port 8080 on the go-web-app Pods. The type: LoadBalancer field tells Kubernetes to provision a cloud load balancer for the Service. This will allow external users to access the go-web-app Pods through the load balancer's public IP address.
